<h1>Hi, I'm @tomeckiStudio</h1>

For as long as I can remember, I have been interested in IT, especially application programming. I expanded my IT knowledge at an IT technical college and now at the UK university (Aberystwyth University). Moreover, I spend most of my free time developing, training and discovering new opportunities. I can create, among other things, websites, applications, mobile games, databases, etc. I participated in several e-commerce projects. My qualities are diligence, conscientiousness and dutifulness. Moreover, I can analyze documentation, look for specific information and I would like to improve my skills all the time. I can talk to a non-IT world, understand business needs. I believe there are no impossible issues in the IT world, and synergy is an engine for innovation. In addition, I collaborate with a great team of similar technology fascinators. Together we form a team for which there are no boundaries in IT.
